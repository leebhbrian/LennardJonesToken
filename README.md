# LennardJonesToken

This is a repository for the codes utilized to develop the Lennard Jones Token (LJT). The smart contract was tested on Sepolia Testnet. The dapp requires Metamask wallet to interact with the LJT smart contract. The smart contract and dapp are created for academic purposes and are not audited for any security concerns. For debugging purposes, the current version of the LJT allows the owner of the contract to assign the position values of LJ clusters.
